"Hello everyone,
I was holding titanium delight card (LTF) and just managed to get hold on platinum maxima with FYF as itâ€™s a good replacement for SBI Prime card.
As per my understanding,
10 RP per Rs 100 on utility bill payments. So if we spend Rs 3,50,000 
3,50,000* 0.1 = 35K points +20k (bonus pts) =55K points & 1 point = .23p to .25p
Hence you can able to save 3.6 to 3.9% which is a good return.";RBL Platinum Maxima

after using the card for months i believe this is completly worth paying annual fees of aprox 6000/-
because every month we get 500/- off on movie ticket plus itâ€™s parterns coupon of 5000/- 
if we calculate we see we are getting benifit of 11000/- (500*12 for movies +5000 voucher against annual fee) upon paying apporx. 6000/- every yearâ€¦ plus reward points ðŸ™‚";SBI ELITE

I hold Feast card since many years and simply love it as it provides 10 percent of value spent on Dining and Entertainment categories. So itâ€™s direct 10 percent of value added as rupees in my account max upto 600 Rs per month.
It had some minor clauses to achieve it but itâ€™s easily achievable. Though major downside of this card is it doesnâ€™t give normal reward points other than above written category.";Kotak Pvr Gold

This is a annual fee card and there is a no options for wavier off. Since i am using this service more than 5 years use to do on time payment.;SBI AIR INDIA PLATINUM
I had very bad experience with SBI credit card. I called Customer care. That time i knew that my card was blocked and my out standing bill was 6,000rs+. Because in my first bill cycle the annual fee was charged and every month interest was adding. Then a called to customer care they waived off the interest amount and i paid 1499rs of annual fees. after couple of days i called customer care and asked for the status. But again it was strange for me that card was deactivate. After paying the annual fee how should they deactivate the card.  I think the moral is if any one face this issue just destroy the card and complaint that we have not received any card. It was a bad experience for me.;SBI AIR INDIA PLATINUM
